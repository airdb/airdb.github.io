# Unit 3 Part 3 - Types of Words

## Segment 1

Here are some different types of words in English.

Words that are nouns or pronouns are used to represent objects.

A noun or a pronoun can be a person, an animal or a thing, including an idea.

Verbs are used to express actions, such as to sit down or stand up.

We also use verbs to express relationships, such as to love someone or to own something.

We use adjectives to describe objects, such as a tall building.

Adjectives are used with nouns and pronouns, but not with verbs.

We use adverbs to describle actions, such as to run fast or to walk slowly.

Adverbs express the quality of an action, such as how well or poorly something is done.

We use conjuctions to connect things or actions, such as to read and write.

Conjunctions include words such as and, or, because, but and yet.
