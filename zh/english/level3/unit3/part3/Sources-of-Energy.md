# Unit 3 Part 3 - Sources of Energy

## Segment 1

Solar energy is one of the cleanest and most plentiful sources of energy.

Solar power depends on sunlight, so in cloudy weather and at night, no power is generated.

Wind energy is non-polluting but is only useful in places where there is a lot of wind.

Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power.

Nuclear energy is efficient and doesn't produce carbon gases as a waste product.

The dangers of nuclear power include deadly radioactive waste products.

A major source of energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.

When we burn fossil fuels, waste gases, such as CO2 are produced.

Fossil fuels remain the largest source of energy for most countries.

Hydropower comes from the kinetic energy of falling water.

Output is reliable and can be regulated to meet the demand, except during periods of drought.


Dams are expensive to build and affect wildlife such as fish.
