# Unit 3 Part 3 - Harry's Business Trip 1

## Segment 1

Harry is on a business trip.

Yesterday he was supposed to fly from San Francisco to Shanghai.

However, things didn't turn out the way they were supposed to.

In fact, nothing went the way it was supposed to.

Everything went wrong and he didn't get on his flight.

As a result he is still in San Francisco.

## Segment 2

The following is a summary of what happened.

Yesterday morning he got up as usual and had breakfast.

Everything seemed to be fine and he was looking forward to the trip.

He was just about to check out of his hotel when he felt a pain.

It was a pain in his lower back.

It was a dull pain at first -- not too bad.

So he didn't worry about it and checked out of the hotel.

Then he got on the shuttle bus to the airport.


## Segment 3

About halfway to the airport, the pain in his back started to get worse.

It was a growing pain, and he was beginning to worry.

Soon it was difficult for him to sit in his seat.

The pain was getting worse.

He wanted to lie down.

He started to sweat and breathe quickly.

He was in real pain then.

On a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was an 8.

## Segment 4

When the bus got to the airport, the bus driver helped him get off.

It was difficlut for him to walk, but he finally made it to the terminal.

Inside the terminal, he went to the men's bathroom.

He went to the toilet, but that didn't help.

Instead of improving, he felt dizzy, and he threw up.

By now he was wet from all his sweating.

He knew he couldn't get on his flight.
