The commpany was established five years ago, and is growing rapidly.

The central office handles the business, advertising, payroll and billing.

It also takes calls from customers, either online or by telephone.

It takes calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

## Segment 3

Sixty percent of the company's employees work from their homes.

When a customer calls in to the central office, a service employee is contacted.

The service employee then contacts the customer and sets up an appointment.

These service employees are highly trained and provide excellent service.

In emergencies, such as a serious plumbing problem, service can be provided within an hour.

One reason for this is that the service employees live in different parts of the city.

They are not centrally located, so it's quicker and easier for them to travel to a customer's home.
